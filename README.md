What is this?
---------------
A Unity decompilation of Plants vs. Goblins 1 using Asset Ripper!

Q/A
----------
Q: Why did you make this?
A: I mostly did this to review and laugh at the bad game code, but also to make an easy excuse to upload my first Unity decompilation on github.

Q: Was this hard?
A: No it wasn't, other than a handful of google play games related errors, it was instantly working in the editor!

Q: Do you plan on updating this?
A: No.

Q: Legal stuff?
A: Well considering that even on newer versions of the game, they don't even use IL2CPP (a code obfuscation method used by most big and even small companies) , i'll assume that they won't care about this (hopefully). EA might though.

A decompilation of Plants vs. Goblins 1 using Asset Ripper!

Q/A
Q: Why did you make this?
A: I mostly did because of funny reasons, but also to make an excuse to unpload my first decompilation on github.

Q: Was this hard?
A: No it wasn't, other than a bunch of google play games related errors, it was instantly working in the editor

Q: Do you plan on updating this?
A: No.

Q: Legal stuff?
A: Well considering that even on newer versions they don't even use IL2CPP i'll assume that they won't care about this, Hopefully, EA might though.
